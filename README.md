# Project2

- <b>Overall Applications Concept</b>: Users can log into the application via a gmail account account. From there users can do one of the following. Create a game or find a game. If a user wants to create a game, they would click on the create game button and fill out the form for that. In contrast, if they wanted to find a game, they can fill out the form and meet up locations will appear on the google map.
<br>
- <b>Motivation for development</b>: We wanted to created an application where it would be easy to meet new people, and connect them through recreation pick up games. Sometimes it can get a bit difficult organizing pick up games, and sometimes it’s difficult finding people. We are helping that our application can help ease those things.
<br>
- <br>Design Process</b>: We wanted to make the application “easy-to-use”. We decided to create two big buttons on the home page. Each button will either take the user to the find game page or the create game page. From there, we created a form to gather information from the user: type of sport, date, time, etc…
- <b>Technologies</b>: Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL, Google Maps API, Handlebars, Sequelize.
